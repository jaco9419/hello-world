# hello-world

I am glad to be part of this community. Hope I can become a greater programmer soon!

I am from Venezuela and have great expectations of starting a career as a programmer. My name is Jorge, as you can see, I am 23 years old and have a bachelor's degree in business administration. However, I have spent the last 5 years teaching English as a second language in several institutes, including one that I am the founder of.

For what I have previously said, I have many interests in life, and programming is something I have been working on for the past few months.

Thank you for reading me,

Jorge CÃ¡ceres.
